# \*nixTime

This is a really simple Pebble watchface which displays the current time, the current date, and the current Unix Timestamp ("epoch time"). Unlike every other epoch time watchface I could find, it only updates once a minute, so is polite to your battery.

It's mostly just the tutorial code. *shrug*.

The weather icons included in were purchased for the use of this project and are licensed separately -- feel free to distribute my code under the terms of the ISC license, but the weather icons are all-rights-reserved [Mike Afford Media](http://www.mikeafford.com/store/index.html).

## TODO

- Sweet animations
- Support for weather providers that are not OWM
