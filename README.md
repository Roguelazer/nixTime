# \*nixTime

This is a really simple Pebble watchface which displays the current time, the current date, and the current Unix Timestamp ("epoch time"). Unlike every other epoch time watchface I could find, it only updates once a minute, so is polite to your battery.

It's mostly just the tutorial code. *shrug*.
